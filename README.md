# Spots â€” Responsive Front-End Project  

**Spots** is a responsive front-end web project that recreates a clean photo-sharing interface inspired by modern social platforms. It focuses on translating a Figma design into a functional layout using **HTML5** and **CSS3**.  

**User Interface & Experience**  
Includes a profile section, editable buttons, and a responsive gallery of image cards with hover states and like icons. The design maintains visual balance and accessibility across all devices.  

**Technical Implementation**  
Built with **semantic HTML** and **modular CSS (BEM)** using **Flexbox**, **Grid**, and **media queries** for responsiveness and scalable design.  

**Visual Design & Figma Reference**  
Developed directly from the **Figma design** for pixel-perfect alignment, color accuracy, and typography.
